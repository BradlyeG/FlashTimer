//This is the source for an app i am making at school for my track and field coah. The goal is to have a simple timer 
//that starts when the gun goes off so the coach can focus on the finish and get better results
// Feel free to read/check out/utilize my source
//But do me a favor and give me credit if you plan on using within your school system
// And don't try to publish it _-_
// That would not be okay
// Cheers,
